## Overview
This paper analyzes the music metadata of three artists *A Boogie Wit da Hoodie*, *Radiohead*, and *Pay money To my Pain* by using the Spotify API to retrieve their audio features. The primary focus of the study is to explore the relationship between song length, release dates, key types, and energy levels for the artists' songs. By visualizing the distribution of song durations and comparing the frequency of major and minor keys, this analysis provides insight into the musical preferences and characteristics of these artists.

The results indicate that A Boogie Wit da Hoodie tends to favor minor keys, with a notable preference for F and G minor, while major keys are less frequent, particularly around C#. Additionally, an energy analysis revealed no significant difference in the energy levels of songs based on the key type, with most songs having moderate energy levels around 0.6. These findings offer a glimpse into the compositional style of A Boogie Wit da Hoodie and, to a lesser extent, the other two artists, showing patterns that reflect broader trends in their respective genresâ€”hip-hop, alternative rock, and post-hardcore.

Future work could involve expanding the dataset to include more audio features, such as tempo and danceability, as well as conducting cross-genre comparisons between artists from different musical backgrounds. These insights could help in understanding how certain audio features correlate with an artist's popularity or influence over time.
